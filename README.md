# EDA-on-100m-running-competition
First EDA project reuploaded

Had to reupload this one because the original one wouldnt render on github.
This is my first 'data analysis' project. Here i make an analysis of the time of winners for the 100m sprint competition for years 1896 through 2016. I also scraped my own data, and applied linear regression model to the model to fit the training data.
